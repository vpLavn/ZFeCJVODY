title: "resouRces: Database for resources to help you learn and teach R"
---


Since I got introduced to R in 2016, I have been accumulating resources that could help me and others in this process. In the past 5 years, I have taken the role of teaching R to people in my lab and university. This database was originally shared as github wiki but finally this 2023, I was able to create an official website for all of you and to make it easier for others to contribute.

Hope you find this useful and feel free to share it with anyone ðŸ˜Š !

Best,

Joscelin
