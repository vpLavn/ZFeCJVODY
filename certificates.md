## Getting your certificate

Congratulations on finishing the course!

You can find your certificate in your enrollment profile (you need to be logged in):

* For the 2025 edition, it's https://courses.datatalks.club/de-zoomcamp-2025/enrollment

If you can't find a certificate in your profile, it means you didn't pass the project.
If you believe it's a mistake, write in the course channel in Slack.

* Log in to your LinkedIn account, then go to your profile.
